# Tennis_Betting
A project which aims to make money by betting on the outcome of tennis matches. I used both a theoretical model and a ML model to come up with my idea of 'the odds' which I then compare with bookmaker's odds to determie how to bet.

## Project Outline
1. Code to communicate with various betting APIs (ommited from this repo).
2. Theoretical Model Exploration - Deriving and testing a more maths based model to predict the outcome of a match.
3. ML Modelling - Using machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of a match.
4. Backtesting - Using the models to inform betting strategies.
